# Exercise 10 - CSS Flex box

Welcome to exercise 10 - let's practice using CSS flex box.

## Steps

1. Create a new folder on your local machine and open it up in VSCode or use an existing folder to work in
2. Create an HTML page in your local working folder (you can call it `index.html` or any name you want)
3. Copy the contents of the `index.html` file in this repository into your newly created HTML file
4. Create a CSS file in your local working folder and call it `style.css`
5. Copy the contents of the `style.css` file in this repository into the local CSS file you created
6. Follow the instructions provided in the `styles.css` file and use the finished example as a guide
7. You don't need to get the colours perfectly, in fact, it's encouraged that you experiment with different colours to enhance your design
8. If you get stuck, have a look inside the `\solution` folder for one way of putting this together
